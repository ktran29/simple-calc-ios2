# simple-calc-iOS

## My task
I implemented an iOS version of the previous simple calculator that was built as a command-line
application. It has a classic "text field and buttons" display, which includes: all ten digits,
the classic operations (+, -, \*, /, %), an equals button, and multi-operand operations
(count, average, factorial). This calculator also includes decimal support and changing numbers
to and from negatives.

## Design
This functionality of this calculator is similar to what you would expect from most others.
However, the one thing that's different is that I designed it more than one operation cannot
be done in succession before the equals button is hit. This way, the calculator remains as
simple as possible while retaining common functionality, but it should still be intuitive to use.
